	* FlexLexer.h: updated file to work with new flex version
	2.5.35. The new version adds a virtual function yywrap() to the
	yyFlexLexer class. This function is automatically defined in any
	lexer source file generated by flex. However because I copied
	FlexLexer.h from an older flex distribution, the function
	definition throughs a "no member function" compiler error.
